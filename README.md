# webScraping
Web Scrapper is a way to collect data from websites. It comes in handy in many different situations. It can be a tidious job if we want to mark down or extract some information from the web and write it down on a file. This is the situation where web scrapping can help.

We need web scrapping for
1. Scraping stock prices
2. Scraping YellowPages Data
3. Scraping store location
4. Scraping Ecommerce sites
5. Scraping sports statistics
6. Or competitor analysis

In this project, I have developed a simple web scrapper and another one with real world usage. The real world example collects and saves the data in a file for further purpose. It also iterates over the time.
